# TypeScript

TypeScript is the default typed layer of the JavaScript ecosystem: browsers, Node.js, Bun, Deno, edge workers, build tooling, and now the compilers themselves (the native TS 7 line). A senior engineer moves fluently between type-level design, module topology, runtime behavior, and the toolchain that binds them.

This pack is an entrypoint plus ten deep references. Read the core rules first; they encode defaults that rarely deserve debate. Then load only the references the task needs. Each reference starts with a one-line scope and carries version floors, decision tables, runnable snippets, anti-patterns, and checklists.

Content targets the stable ecosystem of 2026: TypeScript 5.x with the native 7.x line arriving, Node.js 22/24 LTS, Bun 1.2+, Deno 2.x, React 19+, Vue 3.5+, Svelte 5, Angular 20-era signals, and the current toolchain (Vite/Rolldown, Vitest, Playwright, ESLint 9 flat config, Biome 2, pnpm). Versions move monthly: treat stated numbers as floors and verify upstream before quoting them in deliverables.

## Non-negotiable core rules

1. `"strict": true` is the floor, not the goal. Add `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, and the rest of the hardening set from [08-quality-tooling](./references/08-quality-tooling.md); annotate deliberate escape hatches with a reason.
2. Types are erased. Every I/O boundary (HTTP, env, storage, JSON.parse, postMessage) is parsed with a runtime validator before it becomes a typed value. See [06-backend-node](./references/06-backend-node.md).
3. `unknown` is the default for external data; `any` is a lint error. Non-null assertions are acceptable only immediately after a checked guard.
4. Bundlers and transpilers (esbuild, swc, oxc, Vite, Bun) do not type-check. CI runs `tsc --noEmit` (or the native TS 7 compiler) as a separate gate; see [08-quality-tooling](./references/08-quality-tooling.md).
5. New packages are ESM-first with a single explicit `exports` map. Dual publishing is a deliberate compatibility cost, not a default; see [02-modules-build](./references/02-modules-build.md).
6. `verbatimModuleSyntax` is on; type-only imports use `import type`; a package does not silently mix `require` and top-level `await` semantics.
7. Model states as discriminated unions and parse into them. Prefer literal unions and `as const` objects over `enum`; prefer `satisfies` over widening annotations. See [01-type-system](./references/01-type-system.md).
8. Errors are values or typed exceptions at boundaries, never `catch (e: any)`. Catch clauses take `unknown`; map to domain errors exactly once.
9. No secrets cross into client bundles. Anything exposed through a client-visible prefix (for example `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`) is public forever; see [09-security](./references/09-security.md).
10. React code obeys the rules of hooks and makes the server/client boundary explicit; fetching belongs to the framework or a query library, not to `useEffect`. See [03-react](./references/03-react.md).
11. Tests are deterministic: fixed clocks, seeded randomness, isolated state, no shared mutable fixtures. See [07-testing](./references/07-testing.md).
12. Lockfiles are committed; dependencies are audited in CI and updated on a schedule; published packages use provenance/OIDC trusted publishing. See [09-security](./references/09-security.md).
13. One TypeScript version per repository; toolchain versions are pinned. "Works on my machine" is a bug report, not a resolution.

## Load strategy

- Start with the index below and load at most two references per task; the rules above already cover most reviews.
- Combine one language reference ([01-type-system](./references/01-type-system.md) or [02-modules-build](./references/02-modules-build.md)) with one application reference (React, frameworks, backend, testing) when a task spans both.
- [10-ecosystem-2026](./references/10-ecosystem-2026.md) is the orientation and final-review pass; load it when versions, migrations, or a whole-repo audit are in scope.

## Decision tables

### Type modeling

| Need | Use | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Closed set of states | Discriminated union + exhaustive switch | boolean flag pairs |
| Open set of string values | `string` with runtime validation | giant literal union |
| Named constants | `as const` object or literal union | `enum` |
| Object with defaults | Function returning a full object | exported mutable singleton |
| Opaque identifier | Branded type + constructor/parser | bare `string` everywhere |
| Complex inferred shape | `satisfies` against a type | annotation that widens |
| Deep generic machinery | Small, tested type tests | 200-line conditional types in app code |

### Module and build strategy

| Situation | `module` / `moduleResolution` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App built by Vite/Rollup | `ESNext` / `bundler` | bundler owns resolution |
| Node app, native ESM | `nodenext` / `nodenext` | full ESM semantics |
| Node with `require(esm)` needs | `nodenext` | set `"type"` correctly |
| Library, dual publish | `node16`-compatible + tsdown/tsup | test both `import` and `require` |
| Legacy CJS-only consumer | last resort | isolate in one adapter package |

### Runtime selection

| Need | Default | Alternative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General backend / LTS | Node.js 24 LTS | Node 22 LTS |
| Max dev speed, single binary | Bun 1.2+ | Node + swc |
| Permissions, built-in tooling | Deno 2 | Node |
| Global low-latency edge | Cloudflare Workers | Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge |
| Scripts and CLIs | Node or Bun | Deno with `--allow-*` |

### Framework selection

| Project type | Default | Alternative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full-stack React, content + app | Next.js App Router | TanStack Start, React Router 7 |
| Lightweight multi-runtime API | Hono | Fastify |
| Structured enterprise service | NestJS | Fastify + manual DI |
| Content-first, minimal JS | Astro | SvelteKit static |
| Vue product app | Nuxt 3.5+ / Vite | Vue SPA |
| Svelte product app | SvelteKit + runes | Svelte SPA |

### Testing stack

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit / component | Vitest + Testing Library | jsdom or browser mode |
| Type-level | expect-type inside Vitest | `tsc --noEmit` in CI |
| E2E | Playwright | trace + sharding |
| HTTP mocking | MSW | never hand-rolled fetch stubs |
| Database | Testcontainers | real engine, disposable |
| Property-based | fast-check | seeded, shrinking |

## Port

- **Port id** — `skill://senior/typescript` (version in `metadata.port-version`).
- **Kind** — read-only reference pack; no side effects, no tools required.
- **Entrypoint** — this `SKILL.md`; depth lives in `references/`.
- **Load modes**
  1. Installed agent: `skill({ name: "typescript" })` in OpenCode; Claude Code reads `<skills-dir>/typescript/SKILL.md`.
  2. Orchestrator: read `SKILL.md`, then load only the references the task needs.
  3. Not installed: consumers MUST degrade gracefully using their own guidance and report the degraded mode. Never block on the pack.
- **Consumer contract** — `metadata.consumers` lists the agents that may load it; consumers reference it as `load skill typescript (optional)`.
- **Stability** — `stable`; breaking changes bump `port-version` major.
