# Mobile

Reference pack for building, reviewing, and shipping mobile applications in 2026. It covers the
whole delivery path: how to pick a stack, how to architect iOS and Android apps, how data survives
a bad network and a backgrounded process, how the app stays fast and secure on mid-range hardware,
and how a build reaches a store without breaking.

The pack is framework-aware but not framework-locked: Swift/SwiftUI, Kotlin/Compose, React Native
with Expo, Flutter, and Kotlin Multiplatform appear side by side. Treat named libraries as examples
of a category. Version numbers are floors or ranges; when an API, limit, or store policy matters,
verify upstream.

## Non-Negotiable Core Rules

1. **Pick the stack once, explicitly, against a written decision matrix.** Re-litigating frameworks
   mid-project is the most expensive mobile mistake. Record the choice, the constraints, and the
   exit cost in an ADR.
2. **Design for the device, not the simulator.** Mid-range Android, small batteries, spotty networks,
   low storage, and interrupted sessions are the default; the flagship on Wi-Fi is the exception.
3. **Offline is a state, not an error.** Every read path should render something from local data;
   every write path should queue, reconcile, and show sync status. Assume the network is absent first.
4. **The main thread renders; everything else moves off it.** Disk, network, JSON, image decode,
   crypto, and database work belong off the UI thread on every platform.
5. **Own the lifecycle.** Processes are killed, background work is throttled, permissions are
   revoked, and OS versions drop APIs. Persist through `onPause`/scene disconnect, not just on exit.
6. **Continuous frames are a hard requirement.** Nail the frame budget for the device refresh rate
   (16.7 ms at 60 Hz, 8.3 ms at 120 Hz) and measure in release mode on real hardware.
7. **Secure storage is the only storage for credentials.** Keychain on iOS, Keystore-backed storage
   on Android; never `SharedPreferences`, `UserDefaults`, plists, or plain files for tokens.
8. **Secrets do not ship in the binary.** Anything bundled can be extracted. Server-side keys stay
   server-side; client identifiers are public by definition.
9. **Minimize permissions and justify each one.** Request in context, degrade when denied, and never
   gate the core experience on an optional permission.
10. **Measure startup, memory, and crash-free rate in the field, not only in the lab.** Store vitals
    and crash reporting are part of the definition of done.
11. **Accessibility and localization are correctness.** Screen readers, dynamic type, contrast,
    reduced motion, RTL, and plural rules are built in, not retrofitted.
12. **Automate the release path.** Signing, versioning, notes, screenshots, and uploads are code in
    CI; a release that only one person can perform is a bus factor of one.
13. **Keep platform APIs first choice.** Widgets, live activities, notifications, share sheets,
    biometrics, and background schedulers have system behavior users expect; wrappers leak.

## Decision Tables

### Stack at a glance

| Option | Language / UI | Sharing | Best for | Weak spots |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Native | Swift + SwiftUI; Kotlin + Compose | None | Flagship, platform-deep, performance-critical | Two codebases, highest cost |
| React Native + Expo | TypeScript + RN views | 80-95% (logic + UI) | Product teams with web/TS skills, fast iteration | Native module edges, JS runtime limits |
| Flutter | Dart + own renderer | ~100% | Pixel-identical UI, custom design systems | Larger binary, Dart hiring, platform fidelity gaps |
| Kotlin Multiplatform | Kotlin shared core; Compose or native UI | Logic 100%, UI optional | Existing native apps, shared domain/data layers | iOS toolchain maturity; CMP still evolving |
| .NET MAUI | C# + XAML | ~100% | Microsoft-centric enterprise and LOB apps | Smaller ecosystem, iOS/Android rough edges |

### When native wins

| Signal | Why native |
|---|---|
| Widgets, watch, TV, CarPlay/Android Auto, App Intents | First-class SDK access and release cadence |
| Camera, audio, BLE, AR, ML accelerators | Direct access to platform frameworks and hardware |
| Latency-critical UI (games, camera pipelines, drawing) | No bridge or second runtime in the path |
| Accessibility and platform conventions are product requirements | Native semantics for free |
| Long-lived app with dedicated per-platform teams | Lowest long-term platform friction |

### Data layer at a glance

| Need | Local store | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Relational, queries, migrations | SQLite (Room, GRDB, Drift, SQLDelight) | Default for structured app data |
| Small key/value, flags, prefs | DataStore, MMKV, `NSUserDefaults` (non-sensitive) | Never for tokens |
| Large blobs | Files + metadata index | Keep blobs out of the database |
| Document sync with a backend | Sync engine (PowerSync, Electric, Couchbase Lite, Firestore) | Buy sync before building it |
| Ephemeral cache | In-memory LRU + disk cache | Has an owner, TTL, and invalidation rule |

### Release readiness gates

| Gate | Check |
|---|---|
| Correctness | Crash-free sessions >= 99.5% on the beta track |
| Performance | Startup, frame, and memory budgets verified in release on real devices |
| Security | MASVS checklist passed; no secrets in the bundle; pinning decision recorded |
| Privacy | Store privacy labels/data safety form match actual collection |
| Rollback | Staged rollout plan, kill switch, and hotfix path defined |
| Automation | CI builds, signs, and uploads from a clean checkout |

## How to Use This Pack

- Start from the decision tables, then load only the references the task needs; do not load all nine
  by default.
- New app or stack choice: load 01 first, then the chosen platform reference.
- Feature work with a backend: pair the platform reference with 06 (offline/sync) early.
- Before any release: load 07 (performance), 08 (security), and 09 (release) as a checklist pass.
- References cross-link with relative paths such as `./06-data-offline-sync.md`; follow them when a
  topic borders another domain.

## Port

- **Port id** — `skill://senior/mobile` (version in `metadata.port-version`).
- **Kind** — read-only reference pack; no side effects, no tools, no scripts required.
- **Entrypoint** — this `SKILL.md`; depth lives in `references/`.
- **Load modes**
  1. Installed agent: `skill({ name: "mobile" })` in OpenCode; Claude Code reads
     `<skills-dir>/mobile/SKILL.md`.
  2. Orchestrator: read `SKILL.md`, then load only the references the task needs.
  3. Not installed: consumers MUST degrade gracefully using their own guidance and report the
     degraded mode. Never block on the pack.
- **Consumer contract** — `metadata.consumers` lists the agents that may load it; consumers
  reference it as `load skill mobile (optional)`.
- **Stability** — `stable`; breaking changes bump `port-version` major.
