# Performance

Reference pack for senior performance engineering: measurement, caching, databases, backend profiling, frontend, concurrency and backpressure, memory and GC, load testing, and capacity/cost. Depth lives in `references/`; this file is the map.

## Baseline (2026)

- Performance work is empirical: every change starts from a measured baseline and ends with a re-measurement under comparable conditions. An unmeasured optimization is a guess.
- Latency budgets are dominated by tails. p50 is marketing; p95/p99 plus saturation metrics are engineering. Averages hide the incidents that page people.
- Utilization is the enemy of latency. Queueing behavior means a system at 80-90 percent utilization has non-linear latency growth. Headroom is a design decision, not waste.
- The cheapest request is the one never made, the second cheapest is served from cache, and only then is optimization of the origin path relevant.
- Vendor and cloud defaults (pool sizes, timeouts, GC settings, autoscaling signals) are starting points, not answers; tune against measured load.
- Managed runtimes keep improving (generational collectors, AOT, better JIT), so GC and profiling advice must be re-validated per runtime version — verify upstream.
- Version claims in this pack are floors, ranges, or "verify upstream"; never treat them as pinned exact versions.

## Non-Negotiable Core Rules

1. Measure before and after; keep the number with the change. No optimization merges without a baseline, a method, and a re-measurement at the same load level. See `./references/01-methodology.md`.
2. State the target as a budget: a latency percentile, throughput floor, memory ceiling, or cost-per-request ceiling. "Faster" is not a target.
3. Track tails, not averages: report p50, p95, p99 (and p99.9 for critical paths) with the sample window and load level. See `./references/01-methodology.md`.
4. Bound every resource: connection pools, queues, thread pools, caches, request concurrency, retry counts. Unbounded anything becomes an outage under load. See `./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md`.
5. Cache with an invalidation story. If you cannot name how a cached entry becomes correct again, do not cache it. See `./references/02-caching.md`.
6. Never cache private data without user or tenant scope in the key; never let one tenant's response leak into another's cache. See `./references/02-caching.md`.
7. Every remote call has a timeout, and every retry is bounded, jittered, and idempotent. Retry storms turn a blip into a meltdown. See `./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md`.
8. Database changes are measured against a representative data volume; N+1 and missing indexes rarely show themselves on seed data. See `./references/03-databases.md`.
9. Profile production-like builds with symbols and production-like data shapes; debug builds and toy data produce misleading flamegraphs. See `./references/04-backend-profiling.md`.
10. Frontend performance is tracked with field data (RUM/CrUX), not only lab scores; ship budgets in CI so regressions fail the build. See `./references/05-frontend.md`.
11. Capacity plans include a peak factor and headroom, not just current traffic; autoscaling without a measured saturation signal oscillates or lags. See `./references/09-capacity-cost.md`.
12. Load tests are open or closed models chosen deliberately; closed-loop tests hide coordinated omission and overstate capacity. See `./references/08-load-testing.md`.

## Decision Tables

### First Move by Symptom

| Symptom | First move | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Latency grows with load, CPU flat | Look for queueing, locks, pools, or downstream waits | `./references/01-methodology.md`, `./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md` |
| p99 far above p50 | Find tail sources: GC, lock contention, cold caches, retries, fan-out | `./references/01-methodology.md`, `./references/07-memory-gc.md` |
| Throughput plateaus while load rises | Find the saturated resource: CPU, DB, connection pool, network, lock | `./references/04-backend-profiling.md`, `./references/08-load-testing.md` |
| Database CPU or I/O high | Slow query workflow, plan inspection, index and N+1 review | `./references/03-databases.md` |
| CPU high without traffic growth | Profile CPU and allocations; check busy loops, regex, serialization | `./references/04-backend-profiling.md` |
| Memory grows without bound | Leak detection and GC tuning; inspect retainers and object lifetimes | `./references/07-memory-gc.md` |
| Slow page load or bad INP | Bundle, images, fonts, hydration, and third-party cost | `./references/05-frontend.md` |
| Cost per request rising | Unit economics: traffic mix, instance size, cache hit rate, egress | `./references/09-capacity-cost.md` |

### Cache Layer Selection

| Need | Layer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Static asset repeat visits | Browser / CDN | Long TTL plus content-hash filenames; purge on release |
| Public API response, tolerant of staleness | CDN or shared cache | `s-maxage` plus `stale-while-revalidate`; validate with `ETag` |
| Hot shared data across instances | Redis/Valkey or equivalent | TTL plus jitter; single-flight on miss |
| Per-request repeated reads | In-process (L1) | Short TTL or explicit invalidation; watch memory ceiling |
| Expensive deterministic computation | Application cache | Versioned keys tied to input or schema version |
| Database read amplification | Materialized view or read replica | Not a cache; plan staleness and lag budgets |

### Concurrency and Overload Controls

| Problem | Control | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Unbounded fan-out to a dependency | Bounded concurrency pool or semaphore | `./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md` |
| Queue grows without bound | Bounded queue plus load shedding | `./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md` |
| One tenant consumes the fleet | Per-tenant limits and bulkheads | `./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md` |
| Burst arrives faster than capacity | Admission control; return 429/503 with `Retry-After` | `./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md` |
| Retries amplify an outage | Retry budget, jitter, circuit breaker | `./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md` |
| Scaling lags traffic spikes | Queue-depth or concurrency-based autoscaling | `./references/09-capacity-cost.md` |

### Measurement Tool by Layer

| Layer | Lab | Field / production |
|---|---|---|
| Backend code | Benchmarks, profilers | Continuous profiling, traces |
| Database | `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on cloned volume | `pg_stat_statements` / slow query log |
| API | Load generator against staging | RUM plus server-side latency histograms |
| Frontend | Lighthouse CI, WebPageTest | RUM (CrUX-compatible), INP attribution |
| Capacity | Breakpoint test | Saturation metrics, cost reports |

## Load Order

- First response to any regression: `./references/01-methodology.md`, then the reference matching the symptom table above.
- Latency with unknown cause: `./references/01-methodology.md` -> `./references/04-backend-profiling.md` -> `./references/07-memory-gc.md` or `./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md` depending on the profile.
- Database-shaped problem: `./references/03-databases.md`, with `./references/02-caching.md` if reads dominate.
- Frontend task: `./references/05-frontend.md`, then `./references/01-methodology.md` for budget and measurement discipline.
- Capacity, scaling, or cost work: `./references/09-capacity-cost.md` plus `./references/08-load-testing.md` for evidence.
- Load only the references the task needs; do not inject the whole pack into context.

## Performance Review Workflow

1. Confirm the target: metric, percentile, load level, and budget (`./references/01-methodology.md`).
2. Verify the measurement method: sample size, warmup, environment parity, and noise control.
3. Identify the saturated resource before touching code; classify CPU, memory, I/O, lock, or downstream wait (`./references/04-backend-profiling.md`).
4. For data paths, measure query plans and fan-out on realistic volume (`./references/03-databases.md`).
5. For shared state, check cache correctness, invalidation, and stampede behavior (`./references/02-caching.md`).
6. For overload paths, check bounds, timeouts, retries, and shedding behavior (`./references/06-concurrency-backpressure.md`).
7. For user-facing surfaces, check field metrics and budgets, not just lab scores (`./references/05-frontend.md`).
8. Confirm the change is re-measured and the result recorded with the commit; add a budget gate where regression risk is high.

## Port

- **Port id** — `skill://senior/performance` (version in `metadata.port-version`, currently `2.0.0`).
- **Kind** — read-only reference pack; no side effects, no tools required.
- **Entrypoint** — this `SKILL.md`; depth lives in `references/`.
- **Load modes**
  1. Installed agent: `skill({ name: "performance" })` in OpenCode; Claude Code reads `<skills-dir>/performance/SKILL.md`.
  2. Orchestrator: read `SKILL.md`, then load only the references the task needs.
  3. Not installed: consumers MUST degrade gracefully using their own guidance and report the degraded mode. Never block on the pack.
- **Consumer contract** — `metadata.consumers` lists the agents that may load it; consumers reference it as `load skill performance (optional)`.
- **Stability** — `stable`; breaking changes bump `port-version` major.

## Contract

- References are numbered `01`-`09`; keep them mutually consistent and cross-linked with relative paths.
- Version claims are floors or qualified with "verify upstream"; never present invented exact versions as fact.
- Anti-patterns and checklists close every reference; treat unchecked boxes as review findings.
- No emojis, English only, and no tooling that mutates the user's systems.
